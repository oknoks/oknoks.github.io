# The triptych of LinkedIn content

## Part 1: Content

This is what is what is often recommended for posting content on LinkedIn:

- Having relevance and expertise, 
- sharing insights and valuable information, 
- get engagement from relevant users, 
- time spent viewing a post, 
- consistency (but not more than one post per 12 hours or you are spamming), 
- encouraging interaction, 
- authenticity with your own language and personal reflections, 
- no or few external links, 
- relevant hashtags (max 5 or you are spamming), 
- quality indicators such as clear writing, good grammar, etc., 
- visual media such as documents and collage posts which performs best for engagement rate but photos also above-median engagement rates, 
- text content length of 1300 characters with the first 200 most important because it is what is initially visible in the feed, and readers must click to see more. 

## Part 2: Intent

A short history of LinkedIn. It began as a straightforward job-seeking platform. Then  LinkedIn evolved into a professional networking site. And now for some time, engagement seems to be the most important factor LinkedIn is optimising for. Which most often translates into entertainment. And, it doesn't take long scrolling on LinkedIn to realise that the posts with most engagement and widest reach are often entertainment and not really following the recommendations above. 

This indicates that there are two kinds of users on LinkedIn. One group is trying to use LinkedIn to network professionally. The other is scrolling LinkedIn for some fun while waiting for their coffee. This is good to be aware of. 

So when using LinkedIn as a marketing channel for your content or for networking, then perhaps 50% are there for the entertainment. That's their intent and if you're not meeting that intent with your content you are not relevant and will receive no engagement and your post will disappear into the black hole archives. 

## Part 3: On-brand
As a brand (personal or business) the first question you'd want ask your self when deciding to use social media platforms as a marketing channel is wether you want to play the engagement game or not. If yes is the answer you have to think like MrBeast,  the most successful social media content producer in the world who have mastered the engagement game fully. Here's a line from his "leaked" on-boarding document "How-To-Succeed-At-MrBeast-Production": 

> "Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That’s
> the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the
> best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the
> best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the
> best YOUTUBE videos possible."

However, if you choose not to play the engagement game, you’ll be at a disadvantage compared to professional engagement players on the platform. LinkedIn’s content ranking favours engagement. Content must meet intent or it's dead.

However, compared to most other social media platforms LinkedIn have a high degree of actual users and brands with their real names and trying to network professionally, although fake accounts growing fast and with 121 million fake accounts removed last year.

In any case, trying to play the engagement game while staying true to your brand’s professional tone at the same time is doing two things half-heartedly with a big risk of coming across as unauthentic. So not a good idea unless you are a highly engaging brand to begin with.

So, following the checklist of recommended actions for LinkedIn content, as described in the first part, and being on-brand while keeping in mind the intent of the 50% of users not there for entertainment, is probably the best approach. 


## An example of 1300 characters of text

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

"What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.

A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.

It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used.
